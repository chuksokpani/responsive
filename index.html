            The question is how to make the music business under the purview of social media, coronavirus-proof?
            We have to first bear in mind that the pandemic cripples practically the entire value chain of the music business – from promoters, bands, DJs, lighting directors, ticket sellers, event managers, stage managers, etc. But there’s yet hope, a section of the business that will thrive, should thrive in a pandemic.
            Netflix is a case in point:

                One thing that has not slowed down at all, and has, in fact increased in most parts of the world is the amount of streaming, the number of eyeballs looking to latch unto something fun, something exciting. This is where the music business comes in – “an Industry whose job is to make people happy”.With social media, we can double down on this, by selling nostalgia (because folks will want to remember familiar times when there was more order, normalcy, less chaos): creating playlists of fans’ favourite songs, sharing it - pushing out this content.Like Netflix and chill, #StayHomeAndStream Mavin Music. OR‘This is the time to catch up on all those music videos you haven’t seen (or not seen in a while), from D’Prince’s #TakeBanana - because we all need to eat healthy to fight #COVID19 - to Johnny Drille’s #CountOnYou, because we are all counting on each other to be responsible, to observe social distancing so “we go survive the crazy night” together.
            </p>

                In summary, I will work to make the music business coronavirus proof, with transparency; directing fans to stream more songs, more videos; donate or pay for Facebook live, Instagram live, Periscope concerts – live concerts (alternatively, fans get private links to a channel to view).
